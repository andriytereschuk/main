# Middleware

> `Middleware` **filter** functions, **interceptor** wich allow to manage the data between different parts of a system.

In server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.
