## Programming questions

1. Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?
  > Imperative/procedural programming, functional programming, prototypal inheritance
2. What is functional programming?
  > Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data
3. What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?
  > **Class Inheritance:** instances inherit from classes
  > **Prototypal Inheritance:** instances inherit directly from other objects.
4. What are the pros and cons of monolithic vs microservice architectures?
  > **Monolithic architecture:** one cohesive unit of code whose components are designed to work together, sharing the same memory space and resources.
  > **Microservice architecture:** means that your app is made up of lots of smaller, independent applications capable of running in their own memory space and scaling independently from each other across potentially many separate machines.
5. What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?
  > it means that the engine runs in an event loop to avoid blocking on long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.
6. What is event loop?
