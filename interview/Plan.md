## Programming

* What is functional programming?
    * > programming paradigm - a style of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state, mutable data**, and **side-effects**.
* What are the benefits of functional programming?
    * testing is easier
    * pure functions lend themselves well to techniques like property-based testing
    * debugging is easier
    * programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend
* What is pure functions?
    * > **side-effect-free** function, which given the same inputs, always returns the same output
* What is object oriented programming?
* What is declarative programming?
* What is Immutability?
    * > An immutable object is an object that **can’t be modified** after it’s created. `!!`**const** does not create immutable object.
